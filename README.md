A collection of hands-on labs to help learning the fundamentals of AWS cloud computing services. Each lab has:

* a title,
* a difficulty level (1-3),
* a goal,
* an (optional) architecture diagram,
* instructions, often described using step-by-step, explaining how to run the lab, with textual and sometimes screenshots for visual information,
* often, links to AWS documentation or other relevant information,
* often, procedures to test and validate the lab, and
* optional challenges.

Supporting files such as scripts, policy documents, and CloudFormation templates are provided when relevant to completing the lab.

I hope you enjoy these labs. Suggestions and contributions are welcomed. Thanks!
